### Must be known that Pletenica only have contributed and developed the particle system from this engine, the main core and other functionalities of this engine have been developed by Marc Pag√®s in his project Genesis Engine. We let the link to his repository below:

### Pletenica have developed itself an engine too as a project but we have decided to use Marc's engine cause its better functionalities and advancements, although we will let the link to Overlevende Engine below:

# Particle System

This is the third assignment of a subject(Videogame Engines) from the UPC CITM University. This system have been developed by two students trying their best to learn and contribute to the developing of videogames. 
As said before you can find the two other assignments explained and done in the Pletenica's Overlevende Engine that consist of creating a simple geometry viewer supporting drag and drop files and orbital camera avoiding dependency from FBX for running our games, organize resources coherently and apply the minimal optimizations of a graphics engine.
